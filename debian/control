Description: Distributed social network.

 Growth of web applications has been a huge improvement for social sharing and
 collaborative work. Unfortunately, to enjoy these new tools, we have traded 
 our privacy. Newebe aims to solve this problem by providing a social 
 tool you host at your home and that connects directly with your contacts. 

 Before you ask, Newebe is not like Diaspora, it is thinked distributed in a
 peer-2-peer manner : it is designed to be self-hosted and does not require
 3rd party server.
